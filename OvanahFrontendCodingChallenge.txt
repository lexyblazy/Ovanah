Ovanah Frontend Coding Challenge

Create a react app that displays a 5 day weather forecast.
Send a zip file of all the code.  Include a README about project usage and explain your approach along with technical difficulties.

Minimum tech requirements:
1. Use Redux to hold weather information, user location, api communication status, and authorization status.
2. Use component state to hold entered input.

The api we are using is https://www.metaweather.com/api/.

Screens:

 Screen should display the city name and a row of cards with the weather state image and queried/useful
  information.  The screen must be responsive.
2. Add a search bar with a search button for user to search for a specific city.
If the city name is ambiguous, show a screen with the list of cities to choose from.
 Search bar should be fixed on the top.
3.Create a css spinner when reetriving data from the api. 
Disable search bar input when loading.
4. Show no results screen if no results are returned.
5. Create a login page.  Show this screen first if someone tries to access previous screens if they are not logged in.
Hard code a password in Redux.  Set authorization state in redux.

If you have time, host this on Google Cloud.
